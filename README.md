## Hey.. I learn something new !

Yeah, before today, I didn't know anything about Github Issues, hosting a website on Github, and more, ...
With this exchange session I learned a lot about github. Before, I only knew git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git merge, etc... lol. I didn't know anything about "Trello" on Github, the issues, and the possibility of hosting a site on github. It's all great.
Thanks to [MLSA](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/), Thanks to [Hamidou TESSILIMI](https://www.hamidoutessilimi.me/). :)

### [Repositories (repo) ?](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories)
Can be private or public. Its the place where we store our code like a folder in a laptop.

### [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) / [clone a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) ?
**Clone :**  This action will copy the project in our laptop locally then we can work in a copy of the code. In this action, there will not be any link with the main repo.
**Fork :** This action will create a copy of the project in our board but linking it to the original repo. Everybody can see that the project is not our.

### [Branches ?](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) 
It helps us to manage our project versionning. It's good to create a branch per feature to have a clean project. 

### [Commits ?](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)
It's used to make any modification in the repo.

### [Github issues ?](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
Github issues can be used to track ideas or bugs, etc... With comment, timeline, ...

### [Project board ?](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)
It can help to work together in a team by using it as a task manager (like Trello). There are templates to help you get going fast.

### [Pull requests ?](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
It help you to work in a team. When somebody push his work, he can make a pull request to ask the manager to check and validate his codes. So, the project will not be damaged by a non-functional code. :)

### Hey... I can't list all news informations that I get, it's too much :D
