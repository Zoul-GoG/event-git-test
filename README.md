## Hey.. I learn something new !

Yeah, before today, I didn't know anything about Github Issues, hosting a website on Github, and more, ...
With this exchange session I learned a lot about github. Before, I only knew git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git merge, etc... lol. I didn't know anything about "Trello" on Github, the issues, and the possibility of hosting a site on github. It's all great.
Thanks to MLSA, Thanks to H. TESSILIMI. :)

### Repositories (repo) ?
Can be private or public. Its the place where we store our code like a folder in a laptop.

### Fork/clone a repo ?
**Clone :**  This action will copy the project in our laptop locally then we can work in a copy of the code. In this action, there will not be any link with the main repo.
**Fork :** This action will create a copy of the project in our board but linking it to the original repo. Everybody can see that the project is not our.

### Branches ?
It helps us to manage our project versionning. It's good to create a branch per feature to have a clean project. 

### Commits ?
It's used to make any modification in the repo.

### Github issues ?
Github issues can be used to track ideas or bugs, etc... It can help to work together in a team by using it as a task manager (like Trello)

### Pull requests ? 
It help you to work in a team. When somebody push his work, he can make a pull request to ask the manager to check and validate his codes. So, the project will not be damaged by a non-functional code. :)

### Hey... I can't list all news informations that I get :P)
