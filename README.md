## Hey.. I learn more tools

Yeah, before today, I didn't know anything about Github Issues, hosting a website on Github, and more, ...
With this exchange session I learned a lot about github. Before, I only knew git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git merge, etc... lol. I didn't know anything about "Trello" on Github, the issues, and the possibility of hosting a site on github. It's all great.
Thanks to MLSA, Thanks to H. TESSILIMI. :)
